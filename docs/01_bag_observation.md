## Initial Observation

This project originated from a physical artifact: a coffee bag depicting a tree with an embedded compass and the phrase “Self-awareness is your north.”

The presence of a navigational symbol applied to a sessile organism raises a non-trivial question.

Instead of treating “north” as a metaphor, this project treats it as a reference frame.

The central question becomes whether biological systems maintain or converge upon preferred internal reference frames under oscillatory conditions.

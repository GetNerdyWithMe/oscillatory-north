## Swing as a Forced Pendulum

A swing can be modeled as a simple pendulum:

d²θ/dt² + (g/L) sin(θ) = 0

For small angles:

d²θ/dt² + (g/L) θ = 0

Human pumping introduces a time-dependent forcing term:

d²θ/dt² + (g/L) θ = F_human(t)

This creates multiple possible stable oscillatory states, depending on timing and energy input.

## Eigenmodes of Oscillatory Motion

For linearized oscillatory systems, motion can be decomposed into modes
that oscillate independently.

Each mode has:
- a characteristic shape
- a characteristic frequency
- an associated energetic cost

In constrained systems, only a subset of modes remain dynamically stable.

For a swing, geometric constraints suppress all but the planar mode.

For a tree, asymmetric stiffness and loading bias excitation toward a
dominant bending mode.

Observed motion reflects persistence of the lowest-cost mode under
repeated forcing.

In linear form, modes correspond to eigenvectors of the system stiffness matrix.

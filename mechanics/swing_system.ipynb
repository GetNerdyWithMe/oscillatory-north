# Swing System Model

This notebook will model a human-driven swing as a driven oscillatory system.

The objective is to examine:
- convergence toward stable oscillatory modes
- sensitivity to frequency mismatch
- selection among multiple possible stable rhythms

No claims about psychology or emotion are made here.

## Mode Selection Under Constraint

Both tree sway and swing motion permit multiple degrees of freedom in principle.

In practice, motion collapses onto a dominant mode.

For a swing:
- motion is constrained to a plane by chain geometry
- energy injected outside that plane is dissipated
- stable oscillation persists along a single axis

For a tree:
- wind excites multiple bending directions
- asymmetric stiffness and mass distribution bias response
- repeated loading reinforces a preferred sway axis

In both cases, oscillation becomes organized around the mode that
minimizes structural penalty under repeated forcing.

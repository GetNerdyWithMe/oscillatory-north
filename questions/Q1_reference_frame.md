## Q1: Reference Frame Selection

Do trees exhibit evidence of maintaining a persistent internal reference frame in response to oscillatory mechanical loading (e.g., wind-induced sway)?

Definitions:
- Reference frame: a stable internal basis for orientation or response
- Oscillatory loading: repeated mechanical forcing over time

This question excludes anthropomorphic interpretations and focuses on measurable structural or growth responses.

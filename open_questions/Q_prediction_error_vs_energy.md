## Open Question: Prediction Error vs Energy Minimization

Is oscillatory state selection driven primarily by:
- energy efficiency
- structural integrity
- minimization of prediction error
- or an interaction among these factors?

Current literature addresses components of this question, but lacks cross-domain integration.

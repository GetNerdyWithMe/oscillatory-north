## Tree Sway as a Driven Oscillator

Tree sway under wind loading can be approximated as:

m d²x/dt² + c dx/dt + k x = F_wind(t)

Where:
- m represents effective trunk + canopy mass
- c represents damping due to material and air resistance
- k represents effective stiffness of the trunk
- F_wind(t) represents periodic or stochastic wind forcing

Structural adaptation (e.g., reaction wood) can be modeled as a slow-time adjustment of k:

k = k(t)

This introduces a feedback between oscillatory history and future stability.

## Ecology Module

This section examines trees as mechanically adaptive systems subjected to oscillatory wind loading.

The focus is not on ecological diversity, but on biomechanical response:
- sway frequency
- damping behavior
- structural adaptation (e.g., reaction wood)

Models here are simplified and intended to probe principles, not replicate forests.

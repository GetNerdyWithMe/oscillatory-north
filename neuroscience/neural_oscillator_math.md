## Neural Oscillations as Coupled Systems

Neural rhythms are commonly modeled using coupled oscillators:

dθᵢ/dt = ωᵢ + Σ Kᵢⱼ sin(θⱼ − θᵢ)

Where:
- θᵢ represents the phase of oscillator i
- ωᵢ is its natural frequency
- Kᵢⱼ represents coupling strength

Phase locking occurs when oscillators converge toward stable relative phases.

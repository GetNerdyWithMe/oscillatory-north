## Shared Mathematical Structure

Tree sway, pendulum motion, and neural oscillations all reduce to systems governed by:

- natural frequencies
- damping or coupling
- external forcing
- stability selection

Despite differences in scale and substrate, each system exhibits convergence toward stable oscillatory modes under sustained forcing.

This suggests oscillatory reference frame selection may be a mathematically generic phenomenon.

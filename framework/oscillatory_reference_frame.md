## Oscillatory Reference Frames

Across domains, oscillatory systems often converge toward a dominant, stable rhythm.

This project defines an oscillatory reference frame as:

A dynamically selected oscillatory state that minimizes instability over time under external forcing.

The framework does not assert universality, but highlights repeated emergence across mechanical, ecological, and neural systems.

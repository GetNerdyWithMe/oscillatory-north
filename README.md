# Oscillatory North

This repository explores whether biological systems select a preferred **oscillatory reference frame** (“north”) to reduce structural or informational instability.

The project is motivated by a simple observation:  
multiple biological and mechanical systems exhibit oscillatory behavior, yet consistently converge toward a narrow set of stable rhythms.

Rather than proposing a unified theory, this repository serves as a structured research scaffold connecting:

- tree sway and growth adaptation under wind loading
- human vestibular regulation during rhythmic motion (e.g., swinging)
- neural oscillatory alignment and prediction stability

The emphasis is on modeling, open questions, and cross-domain consistency.

This repository is intentionally incomplete.

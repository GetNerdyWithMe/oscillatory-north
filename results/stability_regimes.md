## Observed Stability Regimes

Across simulations of the canonical oscillator, qualitative behavior is governed primarily by the damping ratio ζ.

Observed regimes:
- Low ζ: sustained oscillations with slow convergence
- Intermediate ζ: rapid convergence to stable oscillatory trajectories
- High ζ: overdamped response with suppressed oscillations

These regimes appear consistently across:
- tree sway models
- swing dynamics
- coupled oscillator systems

This suggests stability selection is parameter-driven rather than domain-specific.

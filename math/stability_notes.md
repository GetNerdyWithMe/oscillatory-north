## Stability Considerations

Stability is assessed by examining equilibrium points and response to perturbation.

Systems exhibiting:
- overdamping suppress oscillation
- underdamping amplify instability
- critical damping balance responsiveness and stability

Preferred oscillatory modes may correspond to regions of maximal robustness.

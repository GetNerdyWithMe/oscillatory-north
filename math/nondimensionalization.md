## Nondimensionalization of the Canonical Oscillator

The canonical driven oscillator is given by:

d²x/dt² + 2ζω₀ dx/dt + ω₀² x = F(t)

Introduce nondimensional time:

τ = ω₀ t

Let x remain dimensionless or scaled by a characteristic length.

Then derivatives transform as:

d/dt = ω₀ d/dτ  
d²/dt² = ω₀² d²/dτ²

Substituting yields:

d²x/dτ² + 2ζ dx/dτ + x = f(τ)

where f(τ) = F(t) / ω₀².

This shows that system behavior depends primarily on:
- damping ratio ζ
- forcing structure f(τ)

The absolute scale of ω₀ does not change qualitative dynamics.

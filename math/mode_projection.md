## Mode Projection in Phase Space

For linearized oscillatory systems written in state form,

ẋ = A x

motion can be decomposed along the eigenvectors of A.

Given a state x(t), its contribution along mode i is given by the projection:

xᵢ(t) = vᵢᵀ x(t)

where vᵢ is the corresponding eigenvector.

Under damping, projections onto non-dominant modes decay over time,
leaving motion aligned with the dominant mode.

## Canonical Oscillator Model

Many biological and mechanical systems can be approximated by the second-order differential equation:

d²x/dt² + 2ζω₀ dx/dt + ω₀² x = F(t)

Where:
- x(t) is displacement or state variable
- ω₀ is the natural frequency
- ζ is the damping ratio
- F(t) is an external forcing function

This equation forms the mathematical basis for tree sway, pendulum motion, and neural oscillations examined in this project.

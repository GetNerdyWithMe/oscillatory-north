## Mathematical Core

All systems examined in this repository are modeled as oscillatory dynamical systems.

The mathematical focus includes:
- second-order differential equations
- damping and forcing terms
- stability and equilibrium analysis
- phase locking and resonance

Models are intentionally minimal to emphasize structure over realism.
